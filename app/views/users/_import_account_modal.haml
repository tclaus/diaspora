              Your profile (name, bio, birthday, gender...) will be updated with the content from the imported account
            %li
              Your settings (theme, visibility...) will be updated with those from the imported account
            %li
              All your aspects and contacts will be added to this account. This will be transparent for them, they will be linked to that account as they were linked with the account you are importing
            %li
              All posts and comments you made with the imported account will be imported in that account and seen as posted by this accounts by the other users

          %p
            If the pod of the account you are importing is offline, your contacts and posts will still be imported, but your contacts will receive a notification as if you started sharing with them.
