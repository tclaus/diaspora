## 1. preface

Societas-Diaspora is an installation of the software of the diaspora\* project. The source code of the software is openly available for anyone to view, download, use and distribute.

diaspora\* is a decentralised social network that allows users to share content, exchange information and have fun.

## 2 Liability for content, links and everything else

The operator of the platform wants to ensure a free exchange of information. The liability for content created by users - posts, messages and more - lies with the user. The operator is in no way liable.

Users are requested not to publish content that violates laws applicable in the Federal Republic of Germany. If content violates laws and the operator is made aware of this, the operator will contact the user, also publicly, and ask for clarification of the problem and, if necessary, deletion of the content. If there is no other possibility, the operator will delete the content.

In addition to the removal of contributions relevant to criminal law, the operator reserves the right to remove content which is on the edge of legality or which cannot be clearly classified, after giving notice. This definition includes in particular but not exclusively pornographic (and possibly erotic) depictions of minors, even if these do not meet the legal definition of "child pornographic writings".

Content previously deleted by the operator or after the operator's request is listed [here]({{link-deletions}}). This list will be updated on an ongoing basis.

## 3. liability for failures and loss of data

The operator makes every effort to operate the platform as free of interruptions and losses as possible. However, no liability is assumed for this.

## 4. copyright

The copyright for texts, images and other media that a user can upload to {{pod name}} remains with the user. There is no transfer to the operator of the pod.

If a user knowingly or unknowingly infringes valid copyright, the user must be notified of this. Contact details can be obtained from the operator.

## 5. data protection

It is important to the operator to protect the data of the users. No data will be evaluated by the operator or passed on to third parties, unless the disclosure is legally enforced. In such a case, the following data may be passed on:

* Username
* e-mail address
* IP address and time of last login

For data sent to other diaspora\* pods or to external services such as Twitter, the operator cannot make any statements. Here, the data protection regulations of the respective platform must be observed.

Unfortunately, nothing is perfect, not even diaspora\*. The operator can therefore not exclude the possibility that data may be accessed through security gaps and attacks on the systems. In the event of data loss, the operator will inform the users.

# 6 Social principles

In the network of diaspora\* it is not possible to ban users or content from the network due to the decentralised and distributed nature of the software. In order to ensure a common togetherness across pod boundaries, the project team of the software maintains rules for dealing with each other. These rules can be viewed [on the project's official website](https://diasporafoundation.org/community_guidelines) and are provided in a variety of languages.

A pleasant climate and friendly and open interaction with each other are important to the operator of this pod. Content that violates the social principles of the project, as well as users who publish such content, can be deleted by the operator after a prior warning. Corresponding deletions will also be included in the list referenced under point 2.
